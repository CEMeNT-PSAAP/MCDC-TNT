# MCDC-TNT
MCDC - **Toy Neutronics Testbed**: A series of codes to investigate the viability of various metaprogramming techniques on a striped down version of MCDC. The techniques we will be using to target performance are:
1. PyKokkos
2. Mako Templates
3. Cython
4. Manual C CUDA kernals


This code will have the following physics implemented:
1. multigroup
2. multiregion (slab geometry)
3. particles produced from fissions
4. egienvalue itterations
5. trainsent modeling


*For thoes about to rock, we salute you*
